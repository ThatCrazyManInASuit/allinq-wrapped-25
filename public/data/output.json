These aliens similar to the ones from arrival but they actually were just giant thin hands that the forearms disapeared into the foggy sky and everytime they appeared a combination of a choir and rapidly ringing bells would ring throughout the sky but it felt like it was more then just sounds? like it was evolved past speech. and if you spoke too loudly they would reach down out of the sky and then pull you down through the ground and the past thing you would see of the person is the top half of their face as it like grows and bulges and by grows i mean like the face would grow to the size of like a small stadium with the eyes bulging muffled screaming then they would disapear along with the bells and choir",

      "How an underlying story point is how community is so important for families and people I general",
      "We look at Marlon who was at the beginning saying how good the home was and how there is a great set of school and community and how it’s so nice and reading a family there would be perfect, then when all that goes away he isolates not only himself but Nemo",
      "He becomes so desperate to keep him safe he strips him of all the fish around him",
      "And through the movie we see Nemo gain companions beyond just his father in the other fish in the tank and they teach him all sorts of things",
      "And one of those things they teach him comes into play in the 3rd act",
      "Where Nemo is like “WE GOTTA SWIM DOWN YALL” to then break the net that all the fish are trapped in right",
      "And that scene alone show how we are better as a community and how absolutely essential it is we work together",
      "And then we look at Marlon’s story",
      "We see him go through soo many situations through the movie but at each of them",
      "He finds help and solution that he normally wouldn’t have found",
      "Of course he finds dory first who is kind his anchor for the whole movie she is the reason his untrustworthiness is pushed to the side",
      "With the sharks we see how his preconceived notions of them were actually wrong",
      "These sharks were nice and were trying to stop eating fish (of course Bruce does eventually kindof go killer mode when he gets blood in his system but even then we see the other two sharks try to stop and forcefully hold back Bruce)",
      "Then after that is the angler scene which doesn’t really bring in too much of an outside source of community but does have Marlon out himself in danger for have dory read the mask",
      "And in a way shows how Somtimes you have to be uncomfortable to help thoes around you",
      "Then after that is the school of fish scene where Marlon just is generally negative to them which doesn’t allow him to take in what they are saying",
      "Then after comes the trench scene where dorys like “we should go through not above” and Marlon is like “no wtf”",
      "But he didn’t catch the part where the school of fish tell dory “for through not over”",
      "And of course this is almost a test for him to see if he’s had any real growth as far as to trust the people around him and of course he doesn’t which leads to the jellyfish scene",
      "Where dory is then hurt and so is Marlon",
      "But AGAIN the other cretures around them save them and actually bring them exactly where they need to be going",
      "Again shaking Marlon’s deep fear of the ocean with kindness and compassion",
      "Then the whale scene where at first he’s like “DORY STFU THIS WHALE AINT GONAN HELP US” but then he see dorys scars from the jellyfish so he trust her",
      "Then they get eaten",
      "but still",
      "Marlon get another test of trust from dory when they are getting swallowed by the whale where he has to let go",
      "And here is the first time we see Marlon give up control over a situation",
      "Which then leads to them being shot up right out to sydney",
      "Then after we get the pelican scene where Marlon has to trust that this pelican knows his son and isn’t gonna eat him",
      "And again more of his community showing up for him",
      "And all that to say",
      "We cannot be so individualistic, we are BUILT off community and trusting eachother",
      "We do own everybody something. We owe them love and trust and kindness",

After many years of harboring those emotions eventually you’re like ykw let me try to move on and have a connection different to the one you used to have with whoever right. So you spend time with them and are having a really good time, but then you see their face in a specific way and then ur reminded of all the things they made you feel. And now Internally you are like “I’m having a really good time right now with this person who hurt me so bad. How do I just move on. How am I having a good time right now.” Then you begin to feel that strong emotion you tried to forget And I think this really complex emotion to be able to conjure in this episode",

For no god can give me what it gives me. Infact the man who I prayed to trembles in fear at the mention of our fated duo. He cries out our names, but just as he did, we do not flock to him. IHOP and I have known abandonment together, but akin to the duo of Ying and Yang, we circle back to each other and always, ALWAYS, know we are forged in each others body. We are bound in ways you have not yet discovered. WE are never fearful or uncomfortable when we are being one. I will never feel that way, for ihop knows. I trust in thee, IHOP restaurant of me",

      "@everyone sorry to @ everyone but...\ni wanna try to do the\n# 2025 ALLINQ (Amazing Lollygagging Lompetition IN Quizbowl)\n**Q:** Skylar, what is Quiz Bowl?\n**A:** Quiz Bowl is a form of trivia that boasts a rather strange way of asking a question, starting with the most obscure fact about something and moving towards more known ideas. Usually, they tend to be academic, but the great thing about hosting your own is that you can control what questions you get! (That means there can be questions about really obscure things that could fit *your* particular niche! (If you've played Quiz Bowl before and found it difficult, don't worry. The Interest Form will ask about your interests/niche, and I will handpick questions based on that.)\n**Q:** Uh, you didn't answer how to play???\n**A:** While someone (me, because I like reading the questions) reads out a question,  without communication, someone on a team of four can buzz in and answer at any time. Answering a question correct awards 10 points to your team, but getting it wrong results in allowing the other teams to listen to the rest of the question, getting them easy clues. Upon getting a correct question, that team may answer bonus questions with discussion to obtain additional points.\n**Q:** Idk... that seems like a lot. Is there a prize or something?\n**A:** Right now I wasn't planning on it, but if it will encourage people to play, I'm willing to put money towards it (or even better, each player puts in a small amount to a pot.)\n**Q:** Well that sounds dandy! How do I sign up?\n**A:** I have an interest form below!! (pleas please please play i want to watch other people play live quiz bowl)\n\nhttps://forms.gle/WbGxVQNW6Wx12TQh8",

      "I saw this compelling argument against AI art today, and I think it’s good:\n“Man, this is exactly why despite disliking generative AI, I absolutely haaaate most arguments against it. it usually boils down to this, people thinking that abstractions somehow matter. Where do you draw the line between AI, using a brush in Photoshop, and drawing things by hand?\n\nThe actual answer, obviously to anyone who thought about it past internet buzzwords and flame wars, is that gen AI, by design, cannot be creative. That is, that it is unable to create new concepts and ideas. It cannot abstract. A brush might be used in new, novel ways by a user of a drawing software, but a generative AI, BY DESIGN, will only always work with what it knows how to do. That is the core distinction.\n\nHowever, this doesn't actually say why AI generation isn't art, it just says that it cannot be creative. Because I am not a weirdo, I know that art is art because it is a work that attempts to transmit an idea. The work part is obvious, the user did the prompt. The transmission, however, is completely contingent on the creator's ability to turn an abstract, unique (unless you want to argue that everyone shares the same kind of conscious thought process) idea into a material thing. There is loss in the process of AI, as the user has less input and cannot tweak every single little thing to perfectly match the abstract idea of what they are trying to make. This is creativity, it's being forced to make a novel way to say something. Even a child's drawing is specific to their idea that they are trying to put on a paper. AI cannot do that, again, by design. Even the weirdest of photoshop brushes can be tweaked into what the user wants specifically.\n\nAnd yes, the direct consequence of this is that if you were the one to make the AI from start to finish, designing every bit of it and putting it into functional code that did exactly what you wanted, it would be art. (cont)”",
      "“Because you would've found a way to perfectly make what you wanted to make. The difference is that users of gen AI aren't doing this, thus it isn't art. QED.”",
      "I’ll need to do more research on it to form an informed opinion",
      "Okay so I’ve done some research and here’s my opinion:\n\nOne big part of the environmental impact of AI is the amount of power it takes. Generally, more power production leads to more CO2, no matter what the source is. Fossil fuel-based power sources produce a crap ton CO2: the combustion and gasification of coal (carbon) creates both CO2 and CO (carbon monoxide), respectively. However, CO2 from renewable power comes from the production and transport of renewable power (think the production and transport of a wind turbine, for example). Although the CO2 produced by renewable sources are a lot less, there’s still a positive correlation between power usage and CO2 production. Training a model like GPT-3 alone takes the power of 120 homes for a year (1287 megawatt hours), which generates 552 tons of CO2. In addition to that, every text generation AI does takes 5 times the hardware power of a google search. It’s projected that in 2026, data centers (which AI relies on) alone could take 5th place in power consumption, right between Japan and Russia, and by 2027, AI could possibly take up 50% of all energy consumption.\n\nThe second big part is how much water AI takes up. A data center requires two liters of chilled water per kilowatt hour consumed (so to train GPT-3, you’d need 2574 kiloliters of chilled water). With how much it’s taking, it’s disrupting our water systems and local ecosystems. \n\nStarting with problem one, I think something similar to others, which is that if we are to continue to pursue AI at our current pace, we must replace all fossil-fuel based power sources (which I agree with anyways, I mean nuclear energy is right there ya scaredy cats).\n\nAs for problem two, there’s not too much of a solution for it. The water will of course eventually reach back into the environment, but it wont be in the same distribution as it was before. That being said, I don’t *think* it’s a huge problem yet",
      "This brings me into a possibly controversial take that I will share when I get home",
      "Yknow before I say what I say I should probably do some research so I can form an informed opinion",
      "so BEFORE i do some research on the topic at hand (ai impact on jobs), here's what I know (truth varying), and I'll share additional details as I find them\nWhat I *think*:\n- post-pandemic, the tech bubble popped, and a lot of people got layed off from various tech companies. keep in mind this was before AI took off\n- from what i know, the layoffs were primarily because there were a lot of people who were being paid rather well for a subpar output. many coders at the time had coding education from bootcamps and such instead of degrees (although people with degrees were surely laid off as well)\n- additionally, during the pandemic, remote working was the trendy new thing that let people keep their jobs while under lockdown. after pandemic, remote workers gave subpar output than people in office due to a lack of direct monitoring, so presumably some were laid off\n- pandemic (and the rise of tiktok users) combined with the lush premise of remote working gave many users the idea of an easy, comfortable, and profitable job, so the supply of devs increase (including future/present cs majors)\n- all of this makes the pandemic tech bubble poppage, but now there's ai\n- from what i've seen, ai could likely be a better coder than the aforementioned \"subpar output\" developers\n- therefore, ai threatens swe jobs\n- the big thing this reminds me of is the use of humans to calculate before computers could calculate. technology historically replaces jobs over time\n\nWhat I don't know:\n- if what i mentioned isn't threatening jobs, then what is? if ai isnt better than humans, then jobs shouldnt be threatened (that being said, very good chance it loops back to good ole fashioned greed)\n- how do swe devs use ai in their work? do devs who use ai have higher output (i predict yes)? what about quality (i predict quality goes down, but the sacrifice is worth it)?\n- will ai eventually replace entire jobs or just parts of it?\n- besides swe, what else will ai affect?\n- compare ai vs dev?",
      "Okay a slight break from my research on societal impact of ai and my ai political opinions",

      "How soon do you need to be there",

      "I’ll time travel it back to you when I have it finished",
      "okay over four months later i've learned a lot about artificial intelligence and my stance towards and after around an hour conversation with carl's dad i think i have the confidence to answer a lot of these questions, which is good considering that AI research is something still i want to pursue, and being well informed about it is good\n\n\"this also doesn't take into account that it steals peoples work for its training data\"\n\nyeah this is true, and id like to say what i had thought four months ago and today. four months ago, i was really trying to grapple exactly *why* it was wrong for an ai to take from unconsenting sources when when we make anything, we also subconsciously draw from sources. it certainly felt wrong that data was being harvested online without people's consent, but i had always thought that anything made available online was free game. today, i realize that even when taken out of the context of ai, stealing art without credit is already very wrong. further more, training an ai on images and text is not the same as the human cognition of decisiveness and creative process/inspiration. since the entire llm thing requires a crapload of data, the internet being the greatest source, its a little sketchy but also technically legal. nonetheless, i can definitely understand why people would not want to contribute to something that threatens their jobs.",
      "this also leads me to the whole \"is ai-generation art?\" thing. before uil regionals, i had a period-long conversation with mr jones about ai art with the following question: imagine two \"drawings\" of completely similarity and quality. why is that i dislike one of the images for being ai-generated despite being the same quality as the other? i've been following anti-ai, pro-ai, ai centrist, and ai discussion communities for a while now, and i think i've garnered a good understanding of all perspectives. to start, my conversation with mr jones practically stripped down to \"what is art?\", and frankly that's a whole can of worms. i think art is subjective, so therefore, i think all stances of \"is ai art?\" are valid. \n\non the anti-ai side, ai art is not art, obviously. it is far too removed from traditional methods, skills, and talent to even begin to be grouped in with art. on the pro-ai side, ai art is art. it creates something that resembles art, so therefore it is art. on my side, i believe ai art is art on a level much more inferior to all \"human\" methods. the only reason why i say its art is because prompt creation takes creativity from the human side, similar to writing. therefore, by transitive properties, the result of prompt creation (creative and descriptive writing in a way) could therefore be described as the result of art, which is art. \n\nhowever, one cannot compare writing prompts to drawing a picture or painting a beautiful scene, for doing these \"human\" mediums require the decision to include and creatively make decisions with a creative process. meanwhile, ai just predicts what a picture could look like from a prompt, not making the decision to include something but instead algorithmically deciding whether a pixel should be blue, pink, or green, which has no creative merit. henceforth, in my mind, it is only the prompt that gives ai art any merit at all. additionally, ai art does not require nearly as much work, skill, and talent as any other art form.",
      "this is why i find ai art to be so far below every other medium of art, and why \"it looks ai generated\" is offensive, which carl's dad was confused about. i can understand why some think of it as art as technically, as you're creatively inputting a prompt, in a roundabout way, it is art. in a discussion with coach vandover on the way home from a tennis tournament, i asked him why he liked writing ai songs, and to paraphrase, he liked the feeling of creating something without needing the time and skills. he still creatively wrote the lyrics and prompt, but the entire instrumental of the song was ai generated. while i will never hold his music with the same regard and respect as other forms of music, im happy that he's happy and has a hobby that he enjoys.\n\nskylor do yku have any opinions on the environmental impact of mass ai usage\n\nid like to revisit this because i do have newer opinions specifically regarding the power consumption of ai. i think nonetheless, as we advance more technologically as a society, our power consumption will go up, regardless of ai usage. power consumption trends will always trend up, so while ai data centers are a large portion of that, we should be able to supply enough power with less pollution regardless. as for the water, it is still unfortunate of the damage it causes to the environment. i do hope that better solutions can be found in the nearby future.",
      "ai and the job market\n\nai has affected so many more jobs than the cs job market now, specifically with entry level positions. notably, it can do the same work as a junior dev much more easily, cheaply, and quickly. with a little debugging from a senior dev, ai can effectively replace a junior dev and equivalents for similar jobs primarily using cognitive knowledge. while this does suck, the only thing it does is add an additional standard, which is to be much better than ai, which is not a very high bar. however, a cs student will likely not succeed in the future without using ai as a tool. at the end of the day, researchers found that generative ai did increase productivity in software developers.\n\nat the end of the day, ai is a tool, and for now, shouldnt be treated as nothing more and nothing less. in the next decade, hopefully we'll see more regulation and legislature on it",

      "Idk what the issue specifically stems from but it makes it annoying when I need steel blocks for example, which come from the compacting drawers",

      "The top square needs to be set to input",
      "The top face is generator power, the back face is output power for machines, the left face is for the system, and the right face is for backup power",
      "Once you have positive net power again (daytime and diesel gen running) send some backup power to the backup cube",
      "Alternatively you can turn off power by setting the back face (bottom right square) to something other than output and that will get you to positive net power",
      "Uh",
      "Oh you mean the ones that are currently helping power everything?",
      "Yeah refilling the back up cube is for when we have full generator power and the system is online",

      "I’ll have to do my own research about gas vs electric cars",
      "It sounds right but also doesn’t",
      "but do the emission released from producing lithium ion batteries + the pollution from disposing them outweigh the emission release from using gas?\nof course electricity itself releases a lot of emissions to generate until alternative methods are implemented (give me nuclear energy you cowards!) and because of all the extra steps im sure theres energy loss but does all that combined outweigh the emissions from gas cars lifetime?",
      "ill do some research on it to procrasinate on my brit lit assignment",
      "yeah im reading it now and seems about right",
      "im looking into the sources (specifically the source by Moseman) and im specifically looking at this section\n> The researchers found that, on average, gasoline cars emit more than 350 grams of CO2 per mile driven over their lifetimes. The hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions, meanwhile, scored at around 260 grams per mile of carbon dioxide, while the fully battery-electric vehicle created just 200 grams. Stats from the U.S. Department of Energy tell a similar story: Using the nationwide average of different energy sources, DOE found that EVs create 3,932 lbs. of CO2 equivalent per year, compared to 5,772 lbs. for plug-in hybrids, 6,258 lbs. for typical hybrids, and 11,435 lbs. for gasoline vehicles.\nand i wonder if the co2 emissions mentioned here are from the batteries and production of an ev considering that ev shouldnt make carbon emissions (at least id assume not, could be wrong)",
      "i can agree with the gas stations/electric stations, range of electric vehicle thing, and the charge wait time",
      "but also isnt the station thing a catch 22 because so long as there arent ev chargers avaliable it will always be a point against evs so because of that ev chargers arent built?",
      "i also found this source (https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/electric-vehicle-myths)\n(obviously it is biased towards the use of electric cars but it is a government source; not sure if that makes it good or bad or anything)",
      "that makes sense",
      "it also makes sense why its better in places that primarily use renewable energy (like european countries) instead of us who use fossil fuels a lot (again, give me nuclear!!!!)",
      "truth all around",
      "the biggest contradictions in research im finding so far is the replacement of the car batteries",
      "this graph is one from the epa but then theres that article from the guy who switched out his battery 4 times and his motor 14 times which makes me wonder if thats a common scenario or if it was that specific guy (if it was just that guy that could be a hasty generalization on evs)",
      "so i guess he would have frequent battery fails",
      "but yeah i guess having to replace them every 8 - 10 years isnt great",
      "(i guess theyve hardly been around for 10 years, now its a matter of whether the replacement rate of batteries [and hence the carbon emissions making them produce] outpaces the carbon emissions from gas car tailpipes)",

      "okay so the batteries win in this case\n2.5-16 metric tons of co2 for 8-10 years of battery use (.25-2 annually) vs 4.6 metric tons of co2 released from gas cars annually\n(note that this does NOT consider emissions from energy production nor the pollution caused from disposal)",
      "i consider the emissions from energy production less of an ev problem and more of a power problem, which is my same stance regarding co2 emissions from AI",
      "if we just had better ways of making energy (and we do have better ways, the republican administration is just against doing nuclear and protecting fossil fuels???) then we wouldnt have such emissions from energy production",
      "co2 emissions aside from lithium, nickel, and cobalt mining, there really are horrible practices when obtaining such materials",

I was walking back towards it and there was a guy laying on the hood. As I got near, he saw me and ran away. Then, three guys jumped out of the bed. Two ran off but one stayed, taunted me, and was about to throw hands. I felt all slow and sluggish (I guess bc I was about to wake up?) but then eventually the fight or flight kicked in. I got my knife out and then the guy ran off. I then just put my knife away and rested by my truck for a second. That wasn’t a good idea bc the guy came back with what looked like jumper cables (that I assume he was going to use as a weapon or to choke me). Then, in traditional dream fashion, Wolverine claws came out of my hands all Hugh Jackman-like and the guy saw and ran back off. I got in my truck, took off, and woke up. Not a fun dream at all",

      "- gamma settings: currently exclusive to PC w/ filters, console players have just been disadvantaged for a while. very good change that's probably going to be pretty easy on their part",
      "- \"go next\" prevention: possibly the most significant change in phase one, the \"going next epidemic\" as it's widely referred to in the community has been the largest issue plaguing the game over the past year or two. there's currently absolutely no penalty for just killing yourself on first hook and screwing the game over for the rest of your team mates if some minor thing doesn't go well for you. they're adding better detection for it and penalizing people who do it, and also adding an incentive system for consecutively playing out hard matches. extremely excited for this.",
      "- hiding prevention: afk crows will now reveal your aura; small, but a very nice change to prevent the rare occasion in which survivors try to stall you out by hiding",
      "- body blocking prevention: afk crows will now also remove collision, so this will prevent the killer just holding a survivor or two in place for several minutes up to an hour to prevent BM that way. also a nice change",
      "- spawn rules: probably the least impactful out of these changes, they're just changing spawn logic to make survivors spawn closer together. it's alright, i suppose.",
      "- map offering balancing: jesus. finally. map offerings will now provide a MAXIMUM, NON-STACKING 20% chance to get a map, instead of a 100% chance to get a map. if go next prevention wasn't the most significant thing here, this 100% is, amazing balance change.",
      "- improved AFK bots: does what it says on the tin",
      "- bulk bp spending: small QoL that'll make spending blood points SIGNIFICANTLY faster, given reaching the previous cap it would take roughly half an hour to spend them all.",
      "- quest system: not much info yet, will provide better rewards than the current daily quests we have",

He asks for my Snapchat (which I had at the time) and then we proceed to talk over Snapchat. This goes on for about a month",
      "Eventually the “friendship” turns into a situation ship and things get a little closer. He started encouraging me to skip class and see him when I can. (Note: I was 14 he was 17). After a while, Mr. Vick caught onto what was happening and Mason decided to stop talking to me. That part did not last long because in a few short weeks, he started talking to me again. So things went back to how they were originally, being closer than friends but never dating",
      "That is until I find out that he went to prom with a girl I didn’t know at all and then i decided to break things off because I was mad. Then we did stop talking for a while but then about a month later, we started talking again. Wasn’t as bad as it was the first few times. He graduated and then turned 18 right after. So you would think after turning 18 he would maybe know… but no",

      "most the of voting was targeted away from Whitney and Mark for a couple reasons:",
      "1: Her reputation on her main show Secret Lives of Mormon Wives, where she was portrayed as the \"villain\" for two seasons",
      "2. Her start on DWTS came out very strong and many people thought she was trying too hard and she was not improving.",
      "but that was not the case for her. She already had the dance talent as it is her degree from college. The fans were outranged and it did not help that her partner was Mark Ballas, a multi winning, long-lasting pro on the show.",
      "The duo faced backlash together, her have been dealing with it for years, but him just now experiencing the hate for the first time",
      "this influenced their main idea for their freestyle",
      "The freestyle is what the duo would have presented as their final dance on DWTS",
      "the dance begins with the song My Way by Frank Sinatra, but a more dramatic, jazz version of it. The duo is wearing bow-tie performance outfits and begin the dance lively and fun. As the first 20 seconds end, Whitney runs into a group in all black with white-screened phones shining in her face. They all do some rapid movements and then Whitney gets lifted into the air and flipped onto the ground.",
      "The lights changed to dark, the music stops and turns into thunder, her outfit changes to a full glitter leotard. As she slowly gets up, a dropped of blood comes out of her mouth as the people in all black shine their phone flashlights on her. They run away as Mark comes and picks her up. They start ballroom dancing slowly to a slow piano version of the song.",
      "They are led to a mirror as the music picks up to upbeat again. As they look in the mirror, they grab some lipstick, and smeer it on. They wipe it off and kiss themselves in the mirror. They begin the dance in a jazzy way again with high kicks and jazz hands. In the song there's a line that says \"i eat it up, and spit it out\" and as this is played the duo gets close and spits up water (i hope).",
      "It ends with a lift from Mark of him swinging Whitney around from his neck with the audio changing to Whitney saying \"I fucking love this show\" which was a line she said in DWTS. And finally a white screen saying \"social media is bad for mental health\" shows",
      "This dance shows the story of Whitney from the past three years. Her transformation from being a performer on tiktok and the show, but then the hate she got from being called a villain and then her slowly accepting her role and embracing herself",
      "It's such a beautiful dance with a beautiful message, it makes me want to dance again",

      "like",

      "like yeah you know what happens but its a different (better) experience",
      "this is why people don't think for themselves now days they need someone in the corner telling you what to think",
      "^ half joke",
      "yeah i can kinda get that",
      "i mean i know this is a unpopular take but the actual game of elden ring barely tells you its story its not really tied to the game plot",
      "but like most games these are intrinsically linked even if you don't notice it",

      "well there aren't many good horror games tbh",
      "i mean yeahh",
      "that is a horrible world view dude",
      "idk its just one of my pet peeves, i think people should interact with media themselves its just more powerful that way. i think this is also a reason that \"media literacy is becoming worse\" because people would rather listen to other people tell them what to think about a story or whatever",
      "*anyway* my point is that you should play ena because thats the intended experience and also because it would be fun to watch MY FRIEND react to what happens (regardless of how much more time, money, patience, and charisma you have than anyone d:)",
      "Especially in a game format because you directly interact with the world",
      "you say that but inherently watching someone else play a game will affect how you feel about it",
      "yipee!!!!",
      "thats another one of my pet peeves is \"video essays\" that just regurgitate the story of a game. to me its like wtf is the point go play and enjoy the thing yourself. everyone is so hungry to consume they don't stop to enjoy the thing itself. just YUM YUM some 20 year old told me what they like about this story!!!",
      "i mean idk sure thats just sad to me though",
      "its how we get \"fans\" of stuff who don't know half of whats going on",
      "like the reason the game was made was to tell its story through its medium not for some random guy to read the wikipedia plot synopsis at you",
      "lol i mean idk man what if",
      "its like if a guy told you he just reads the cliff notes for every book he is interested in, its like ok man but whats the point",
      "video games (atleast when they are good) are even a step above that because you are like directly interacting with the story",
      "(not saying games are better than books, they are different mediums)",
      "skylar that like isnt a good game then so it wouldn't be \"best thing ever in the history of gaming storytelling\"",
      "then yes in this hyper specific scenerio sure i wouldn't really care if people just interacted with the story and not the game",
      "im sure this pops up anyway",
      "dude",
      "not every game is literal complete ass and garbage though",
      "i mean if you view it with that mindset that just sucks why even bother",
      "what are you even arguing here",
      "no skylar i wouldn't play omori if it costed 120 but it doesn;t",
      "if i didn't want to play a game why would i want to watch it",
      "omori is like a huge example of interacting with the game world influencing the story and how you feel about everything",
      "like idc if you do this it doesn't really matter, it just is a little sad to me",
      "then like... why do you want to watch it??",
      "i mean yeah",
      "idk i get you",
      "but theres never been a time where im like \"glad i watched that instead of played it myself!\" (talking about like good games here)",
      "this goes for movies... books...",
      "like if im interested in the story of the game ill hold off until im able to play myself",
      "like christain got to play undertale and be in that world. now image she just watched some guy play it then told us what she thought about it??",
      "like sure i guess you know what happens but like",
      "thats just kinda lame to me",
      "i mean its not black and white im not gonna judge you for reading about elden ring lore because that game is bullshit to play",
      "i mean side argument but you would have to read about elden rings lore seperately anyway imo",
      "i mean yeah its valid to say \"i dont care about playing this game, like i dont really want to experience this\" and like watch or listen to someone talk about it",
      "theres nothing wrong with doing it, but like it IS a worse experience than doing it yourself\ntheres just like a degree of seperation",
      "which brings me to like why would you watch someone play ENA if you wanted to experience it yourself?? expecially since its free!!",
      "thats what im getting at",
      "also honestly it doesn't really matter that much but this is just a specific thing to me",
      "i mean yeah but you can't say its as good as playing it yourself and for me i wouldn't want to ruin that experience for myself",

      "oh yeah 100% agree",
      "but how like last season was also a vehicle to explore simon",
      "and like other characters too",
      "cause like fionna and cake have to have a reason to do things",
      "oh yeah more 1000 years+ stuff would be cool",

      "but there is stuff to explore there i mean both pb and marcy are alive presumably and they have not been shown and like the dog kingdom",
      "probably dealing with the fact that they kinda decided that some people get to be magic and others dont",
      "like why does cake get to be magic? and like fionna living in her real world cant like do \"adventures\" right?",

      "but like",
      "cake is just a magical cat now",
      "no sacrifices there",
      "which like is cool because you can argue that talking cake is the better version but like",

      "first episode is free i think so",
      "lol",
      "its a sci fi show. tone is weird cause the first episode is genuinely pretty scary and the circumstances/situation is like a cosmic horror but its more of like a character driven show? like its not a horror show its a drama. its made by the guy who did breaking bad/better call saul so its similar to that but y'know",

      "yeah its awesome",
      "maybe but most skins make the app unusable lol",
      "speaking of earthbound",
      "idk how far ill get but i have an idea for a rom hack",
      "70~ years after earthbound. monster hunter guy gets a call about about a missing girl in the town of \"Sikesteen\". when he arrives he finds the town invaded with monsters and terrorizing townsfolk. you try to form a search party and look in the nearby forest, but monsters and the poor whether/time of day make this nearly impossible + townsfolk don't really seem all too enthused about finding this girl anyway: most of them are creeped out by her or aren't really concerned. while in the forest yourself you find out that the leader of the monsters is in a nearby cave. after staying the night, local police convince you to stay and deal with the monster problem (probably bribery. offering the money he would of got for finding the girl). there is a cliff/mountain side next to the town and the police escort you up. turns out inside this cave you find out the monsters are in some kind of cult/group that want to bring back giygas, and... they also have the girl. leader of the monsters + first boss is the minotaur dude\n\ni have more than that but thats the rough opening idea, the girl is like a 'reincarnation' of Giygas somehow and thats why the monsters want her/why townspeople don't really like her. PSI is not a common occurrence and they are scared of her abilites",
      "after you find the goal the main plot is sprung by the fact that you are part of a monster hunter guild that opposes magic, so you feel you have to bring the girl back to the guild. she obv hates you and you don't like her but need eachother to survive + grow to like eachother and main guy learns to respect PSI. its like a joel and ellie type dynamic",
      "final boss is superiors of giygas coming to earth to finish the job dragon ball style",
      "yeah that would be like the next story beat",
      "idk like what all happens after cause there would need to be some other spurring moment cause obviously you wont ever actually take her to the guild",
      "or maybe you do and then feel guilty",
      "and go back in to save her\\",
      "anyway at some point i also want you to meet a really old hermit ness, hes the one to kinda bring the girl out of her shell and have the hunter guy come around to PSI. he joins your party",
      "idk how its gonna link together yet but",
      "and this is pretty ambitious so y'know",
      "yeah",
      "yeah basically lol",
      "then for the fourth party member i want it to be like a robot or alien",
      "or maybe like a dinosaur or something",
      "like something you normally wouldn't have in an earthbound party",
      "yeah",
      "mr saturns will be involved in that somehow because they will let you go to the weird scary dimension to fight them",
      "yeah i like that idea, its like the mandalorian",
      "id be like the cops in earthbound where you fight a bunch in a row",
      "also the name of the next town is Sevenstill and everyone will be frozen when you get there",
      "i think like the loop will be that each town needs a monster hunter and you get all your money from beating the boss at the end of each area",
      "instead of just being able to call your dad",
      "lol",
      "the boss would some weird time alien idk",
      "the minotaur popped in my head instantly but idk what that one would be",
      "they would be more grounded like they would be an actual alien like giygas was in mother 1",
      "this is their face and the rest of their body would be with the battle background",
      "like the prospective would be their face really close to you",
      "the implication would be that its like.. an abusive mother type figure to giygas to bring it full circle",
      "i want the ending to be like giygas's soul/mind coming to peace and choosing to love/saving earth",
      "yeah cause like",
      "corruption will always exist... ness alone wont stop that. nobody can\ni think mother 3 touches on this a lot too",
      "but you can choose to fight corruption and not let it consume you",
      "some kind of message like that",
      "cause giygas was never really 'evil'. just scared and confused\nthe ending of mother 1 is that you sing him his childhood lullaby and he gets to emotional and leaves lol",
      "coilsnake has a bunch of tutorials and other programs it works with",
      "same",

      "i also wanna look at how to use the music editor tracker cause i wanna put songs from other games into the hack but i think i'd have to do it manually",
      "Sikesteen pre-saving would be 'Heres some weapons' from mario rpg",
      "for example",

      "thats how terraria balances it with how you transition into hardmode so a similar thing in a mc mod would be cool",
      "yeah but terraria is more of an action adventure game so grinding rarely gets boring where as in mc its just the same thing",
      "of course thats a consequence of playing mc for 10 years more than anything",
      "but mc doesn't excel at exploration or combat so yeah i agree its kind of hard to add more to the item progrssion when, honestly, there isn't much of a need to go beyond iron tools and a diamond pickaxe",
      "like netherites purpose is to prevent your armor and tools from getting deleted when in contact with lava? problem is its a super like annoyingly rare ore that your only going to find super late game where guess what: 1) you've probably already beaten the game 2) don't really have a reason to go into the nether anymore.\nby the time you get netherite you are probably not even going to die to lava anyway",
      "plus theres fire resist pots",
      "now if only there was a \"final\" boss of sorts that required you to have survivability in lava/fire environments where you would need an item that would grant you that, where the materials to make that are naturally deeper underground CLOSE to lava... obsidian skull and wof... terraria just has a way tighter designed progression",
      "minecraft does too but it only has like two steps",
      "and its not bad just very loose, which to be fair kinda works for that game cause its more of a sandbox creative tool first",
      "yeah thats actually very true i think. which is a double edged sword because it does not lend well to replayability/burnout",
      "yeah idk]",
      "its hard to wrap my head around",
      "cause they are so similar but i would say terraria is way more fun generally than mc is",

      "oh yeah and in terraria there isnt an f'ing hunger bar",
      "to be fair it really isn't that bad in minecraft i just think its an unfun design choice",

      "hunger is annoying in design cause its annoying in real life",
      "in real life you get yummy tastes though",

      "yeah exactly",
      "don't starve's hunger bar works because the point of the damn game is to find food and its designed around that",

      "and directional dynamic lights",
      "yeah",
      "its cause minecrafts lighting system sucks balls",
      "idk i think its possible\ni think the way to do it would be to make it its own system that sits on top of the lighting engine",
      "you can very \"easily\" edit the engine with mixins",
      "yeah it would probably be done through a shader system yeah",
      "but like not like a shader pack just like normal shaders in game",

      "see its possible",

      "yeah exactly",

      "||like melinoe should still hate chronos ??? and like she is justified in it! this chronos didn't raise her, he incited a war and is a monster. this character actively was the one that ripped her away from her childhood. like i feel like the ending could have worked a little id melinoe had more like... agency in any of the choices at the end? like this is her game and she is the protag but zagreus makes like every decision in the end. kinda messed up for a game with a female protag and that sets up a bunch of abuser/victim relationsships through out the game with chronos/mel obv and odysseus/schylla, and the curses that haunt arachne, narcissus and echo from various gods. (which also seem like they aren't going to be payed off? idk maybe i just have not reached the end of those plot lines.)||",

But then an I said \"You're probably going to see snow this year yadda yadda yadda\" and then an animated title card appeared with what I was just saying???\nAfter that we went downstairs and we were in a huge building what was sleek and white with a buncha glass windows everywhere and an entrance area that looked kinda like the schools (it even had an office where a buncha friends were but I cant remember any specific faces, maybe ryan was one?) Also coach McClain was there teaching tennis and i kept trying to move out of the way. Also dream me was confused trying to remember if I bought the otter or found him\nThe last scene was me and the otter chilling in the back seat of a car in a buncha blankets chilling (I think we were going to get his nails clipped or smth) also no one was in the front seat driving",

      "Jade Beaty\nApril 30 at 2:54 PM\nHi Luke! Your analysis presents a clear contrast between 1984 and A Clockwork Orange, especially in tone and language. I agree that 1984’s ending reinforces a deep sense of hopelessness, emphasizing the oppressive power of totalitarian regimes. The use of fear and control in Orwell’s depiction of Oceania is chilling and effective. Regarding A Clockwork Orange, your frustration with the slang is understandable—Burgess’s invented language can be a barrier for many readers. However, it also immerses readers in the protagonist’s world, highlighting themes of identity and manipulation. Both novels uniquely explore control and freedom, though in very different stylistic and narrative ways.",

As we all probably know I get a little upset when a car gets abused, but I get it, maintenance can be hard and expensive. So with me officially having a small shop of my own I can work of I am proud to announce that I will now be doing maintenance for cheap! Oil changes, tire rotations, greasing, coolant flushes, anything you can think of you can probably just ask me and I’ll let you know if I can do it. If you want to schedule me to do any work just text me, it’s that easy. I’m assuming oil changes are going to end up being the most that I do, so I bet I can do oil changes for ~$50 (oil and filters cost about 40, give me some credit here).
